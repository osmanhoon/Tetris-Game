# Tetris-Game

#Introduction
Welcome to the classic world of Tetris, now brought to life with Python! Tetris, the iconic puzzle game originally created by Alexey Pajitnov, challenges players to fit falling tetrominoes into a well without gaps. As the pieces stack up, players must think quickly and strategically to clear rows and prevent the stack from reaching the top.
